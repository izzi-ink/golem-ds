I first started programming when I was 10 or 11, but I have always been a writer. I love code and I love words. I envy mathematicians their nimble minds and wish I was more Spock than Kirk.

I draw and doodle to make sense of the complex. I simplify and re-order, I design.

This is a collection of blog posts, inspired by the Notebooks on Code. Sometimes it is specific to a project, sometimes it is a general thought. I hope you enjoy it.
