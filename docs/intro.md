# Introduction

This is a collection of notes  for learning JavaScript. I don't consider myself an expert. I started writing these notes for myself. I hope that they will be useful to others as well.

Let's discover **JavaScript together**.

## Getting Started

I am a great supporter of **essential intent**, I believe if you fully understand why you want to do something, and if you comprehend the essential intent, you will achieve the desired outcome.

The essential intent means to understand the **action** te be performed, **who** you are doing it for, and what the **outcome** will look like and **by when** you want to achieve this. 

It may sound deceptively simple, but do not fool yourself into believing you have the answers.
**Essential Intent** means to really dig deep, to look at yourself and take youself and your efforts serious. 

Once you are clear why you are on the journey, let's get practical and get some tools ready!

## What you'll need

Get started by **downloading VS Code**.

Download **the latest version** of **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.
You are welcome to use any other code editor, but I will be using VS Code for all the lessons.
