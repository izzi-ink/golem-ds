# JS Primer

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language used for creating interactive web pages and web applications. Some key concepts that a student should know about JavaScript include:

1. Values
2. Operations
3. Variables
4. Expressions and Statements
5. Decisions
6. Loops
7. Functions

## Values

In JavaScript, values can be of several data types such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, etc.

## Operations

JavaScript supports various arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations that can be used to manipulate values.

## Variables

Variables are containers for storing values. They are declared using the var, let, or const keywords.

## Expressions and Statements

An expression is a piece of code that produces a value, while a statement is a complete unit of execution. For example, x = 2 is an expression, while if (x > 1) {...} is a statement.

## Decisions

JavaScript has conditional statements (if-else) that allow you to execute different code blocks based on different conditions.

## Loops

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. JavaScript has two types of loops: for loops and while loops.

## Functions

Functions are blocks of code that can be reused and are useful for breaking down a program into smaller, reusable pieces. Functions can be defined using the function keyword and can accept arguments and return values.

By understanding these concepts, a student will have a good foundation for learning more advanced topics in JavaScript and developing complex web applications.
