# Hello World

Here's a simple example of a JavaScript function:

```javascript

var writer = "Izzi";
var github = "izzi-ink";
var age = 52; 

function whoAmI(myName, myNickname, myAge)
    
    console.log(`Hello World, I am called ${myName}, on GitHub I am ${myNickname}, and myAge is ${myAge}`);

whoAmI(writer, github, age);
```
